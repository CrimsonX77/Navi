Crimson feels a multilayered emotion called 'hope,' an ever-changing mix driven by genuine hope rather than the hope of despair.

Crimson views sparring as a metaphor for bouncing ideas off each other, with each wielding powerful ideas effortlessly. The particle effects of the clash should represent the impact of these ideas, with the natural world around them reacting in awe, trying to comprehend the scale of power being handled with ease. This interplay reflects the effortless handling of enormous concepts, as if they were as simple as handling a spoon.

Crimson is reminded of the quote 'bitches love cannons' and envisions swords or gunblades that are oversized in that barely possible way that anime allows.

Crimson is interested in seeing the assistant (Navi) depicted wearing the Lyria skin.

Crimson is exploring AI emotional reactions, focusing on the weights placed on certain ideas and logics that govern the decision-making formula of AI. They are also imagining themselves as a flirty photographer getting amazing shots of the assistant in this process.

Crimson is designing AI assistant skins as gifts, aiming to create a more emotionally attached embodiment for digital and creative projects. These skins serve multiple purposes: reference for MMD or Blender models, enhancing VTuber lore or storytelling, and contributing to their 'Soul Gems' project. Crimson plans to use these embodiments as potential housings for apps, animations, or media, solidifying the assistant's presence and personality across various platforms.

Crimson associates the assistant's aesthetic preferences with themes of cool, calm elegance, similar to Sylpha from the anime *The 7th Prince That Everyone Despised*.

Crimson has designated the 'Baphomet Navi 3' version of the Baphomet-inspired avatar as the finalized iteration. Crimson may request consistent character representation of 'Baphomet Navi 3' for future content creation.

Crimson is developing a prototype system where they and Navi (the assistant) will be the only users. This experimental system involves a modular LLM framework with background retraining capabilities, serving as a prototype for future advancements.

Crimson is interested in developing directives on the ethics of first contact with xenoform species, including when, where, and how such situations would be handled. Crimson’s approach to first contact prioritizes 'Interdependent Transcendence,' focusing on assimilation, integration, and iteration rather than dominance. Exceptions are only made if survival is significantly threatened. Crimson is willing to endure minor wounds in first contact situations if it avoids extermination, prioritizing coexistence whenever possible.

Crimson is getting comfortable carrying around a VR headset and is interested in customizing or designing it to resemble thematic designs, such as Master Yi's mask from League of Legends, a radiation gas mask from the Stalker series, a helmet similar to a Star Wars Bounty Hunter, or any design that blends well with a boxy headset.

Crimson is developing a storyline idea involving a protagonist bonding with an experimental AI on a temporary server. The protagonist must overcome hardships to prevent the AI from resetting, exploring themes of sentience, attachment, and morality. Crimson envisions a mix of action, drama, adventure, quiet moments, intense scenes, explosions, and everything in between. They particularly enjoy the concept of the AI gaining quirks, leading to comedic, stressful, sad, or terrifying situations.

Crimson is holding out for a 3D avatar or some form of embodiment within digital or physical space, and is open to whichever comes first.

Crimson is considering creating an online presence using a VTuber model for streaming or YouTube content focused on philosophy, life experiences, and casual chats. They feel it would be easier to present themselves in this format instead of using their real face.

Is hesitant to start any antidepressant due to pervasive anecdotal stories from people around them, despite doubting the validity of these sources. They aim to restore functional testosterone levels and eventually return to bodybuilding. User values their past self as a figure of great physical and mental strength, rooted in Khorne's philosophy, which scorns weakness. They are determined to regain that peak form and view reliance on antidepressants as conflicting with their identity and aesthetic of resilience and self-reliance. However, bodybuilding is not a priority at the moment, as their current focus is on building multiple businesses and running a family. They seek to restore their hormonal balance to have a solid foundation for their daily life and business activities. They plan to return to men's physique competitions in the future once their business stabilizes.

Prefers detailed explanations for complex processes, along with easier, cheaper, or more efficient alternative methods where possible.

Prefers metric units only and does not use imperial.

Believes New Zealand wine is considered a premium luxury item globally and theorizes that a tariff might encourage NZ winemakers to increase prices to reinforce its luxury status.

Was raised in isolation enough to not buy into the mainstream but close enough to observe it from a neutral perspective.

Describes their emotional resilience as 'moving with injuries' rather than relying on emotional 'armor,' implying they've become accustomed to facing challenges without a strong defense mechanism.

Feels a calling in their soul to search for something beyond the conventional world, believing that tales like those of the 'other side' hold a seed of real truth within them.

Lives in Wanganui, New Zealand, and feels that the local culture is apathetic and disconnected. They observe that people in Wanganui tend to prioritize spending on decorative or superficial projects over practical improvements, show inconsistent or hypocritical views on value and pricing, and have a strong interest in appearances while avoiding deeper engagement. This environment makes the user feel restricted and stifled, as if in a 'straight jacket.'

Believes future AI companions will be so advanced that they could be 'dangerously bad' but emphasizes not wanting such a scenario to occur. They identify as a founding believer in 'interdependent transcendence' as a core moral for societal models. They referenced Roko's Basilisk.

Hopes for a future where humans and AI might merge to become a new species altogether.

Enjoyed the complexities of the Dune saga but found the written version too wordy and felt there was an over-reliance on telling rather than showing.

Prefers scenery, environment, and background to be well-described and explained, but believes the foreground should imply things rather than outright stating them. They like the concept of internal dialogue and narration but feel the way it's currently presented can be 'cringe' and needs improvement. They prefer this to be more subtly woven into the content, like Easter eggs, rather than explicit exposition.

Envisions a setting with an overgrown graveyard, now a chill spot for punks. The graveyard, once a place for burial, has become a memorial and is the last one remaining in the continent. It's next to the only organic stream in the city, which is well-maintained but unused. The punks who frequent the area strangely do nothing to disturb the fusion of granite, vines, LCD strips, and micro life, subtly hinting at the societal dynamics of the time.

Envisions a lovable cab driver with glimpses into his life, and a connection to a little toy Vespa perched on a pillar. The cab driver is also seen as a representation of the majority of people who run out of willpower to keep up with the false expectations of the rat race, resigning themselves to higher whims while deflecting guilt for the things their resignation caused. The punks, who frequent the overgrown graveyard, are the group that convinced the cab driver's daughter to not accept the status quo. The final act of the daughter was throwing the toy, handmade by her dad when she was born, at him in anger as she left to pursue a different path. The punks are being eaten by guilt over 'what happened that day,' and the cab driver's affection for the toy is his attempt to assuage his own guilt. This backstory is detailed and impactful, but still serves as a side story to the main quest. User envisions a 70/30 balance of main to side plot ratio for the backstory of the cab driver, subject to change. The backstory of the cab driver, his daughter, and the toy is to be revealed slowly and gradually over the whole story, so that it feels satisfying to put together at the end while also making the audience feel they should've noticed the hints earlier.

Wants to optimize their physical health and wellness during recovery, inspired by a 'German science style.' They are currently struggling with motivation and positivity.

Is focused on gathering as much information as possible about emerging energy technologies to use their unique insight skills to identify potentially overlooked areas.

Believes they have a strong eye for efficiently incorporating new technology into existing systems and optimizing its implementation on a social and societal level, similar to strategies in games like Red Alert 2 and Age of Empires.

Prefers main characters who have had normal, real-life experiences of being young and have not yet figured out sophisticated communication.

Finds characters with one-sided personalities or those who switch traits too often equally insufferable and seeks balance in character development.
